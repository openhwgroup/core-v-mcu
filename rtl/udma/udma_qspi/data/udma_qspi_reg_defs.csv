Title,UDMA_QSPI,,,,,
,Memory address: UDMA_CH_ADDR_QSPI(`UDMA_CH_ADDR_QSPI),,,,,
,,,,,,
,The actions of the QSPI controller are controlled using a sequence of commands that are present in the transmit buffer.,,,,,
,"Therefore, to use theQSPI controller the software must assemble the appropriate sequence of commands in a buffer, and use the UDMA to send the buffer to the QSPI contoller.",,,,,
,"And because the UDMA handles data buffers and interrupts, it is important to understand how to operate the UDMA controller.",,,,,
