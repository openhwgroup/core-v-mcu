Sleep Unit
==========

Source File: :file:`rtl/cv32e40p_sleep_unit.sv`

The Sleep Unit contains and controls the instantiated clock gate, see :ref:`clock-gating-cell`, that gates ``clk_i`` and produces a gated clock
for use by the other modules inside CV32E40P. The Sleep Unit is the only place in which ``clk_i`` itself is used; all
other modules use the gated version of ``clk_i``.

The clock gating in the Sleep Unit is impacted by the following:

 * ``rst_ni``
 * ``fetch_enable_i``
 * **wfi** instruction (only when ``PULP_CLUSTER`` = 0)
 * **cv.elw** instruction (only when ``PULP_CLUSTER`` = 1)
 * ``pulp_clock_en_i`` (only when ``PULP_CLUSTER`` = 1)

.. note::

   The semantics of ``pulp_clock_en_i`` and ``core_sleep_o`` depend on the ``PULP_CLUSTER`` parameter.

Startup behavior
----------------

``clk_i`` is internally gated off (while signaling ``core_sleep_o`` = 0) during CV32E40P startup:

 * ``clk_i`` is internally gated off during ``rst_ni`` assertion
 * ``clk_i`` is internally gated off from ``rst_ni`` deassertion until ``fetch_enable_i`` = 1

After initial assertion of ``fetch_enable_i``, the ``fetch_enable_i`` signal is ignored until after a next reset assertion.

.. _wfi:

WFI
---

The **wfi** instruction can under certain conditions be used to enter sleep mode awaiting a locally enabled
interrupt to become pending. The operation of **wfi** is unaffected by the global interrupt bits in **mstatus**.

A **wfi** will not enter sleep mode, but will be executed as a regular **nop**, if any of the following conditions apply:

 * ``debug_req_i`` = 1 or a debug request is pending
 * The core is in debug mode
 * The core is performing single stepping (debug)
 * The core has a trigger match (debug)
 * ``PULP_CLUSTER`` = 1

If a **wfi** causes sleep mode entry, then ``core_sleep_o`` is set to 1 and ``clk_i`` is gated off internally. ``clk_i`` is
allowed to be gated off externally as well in this scenario. A wake-up can be triggered by any of the following:

 * A locally enabled interrupt is pending
 * A debug request is pending
 * Core is in debug mode

Upon wake-up ``core_sleep_o`` is set to 0, ``clk_i`` will no longer be gated internally, must not be gated off externally, and
instruction execution resumes.

If one of the above wake-up conditions coincides with the **wfi** instruction, then sleep mode is not entered and ``core_sleep_o``
will not become 1.

.. _pulp_cluster:

PULP Cluster Extension
----------------------

CV32E40P has an optional extension to enable its usage in a PULP Cluster in the PULP (Parallel Ultra Low Power) platform.
This extension is enabled by setting the ``PULP_CLUSTER`` parameter to 1. The PULP platform is organized as clusters of
multiple (typically 4 or 8) CV32E40P cores that share a tightly-coupled data memory, aimed at running digital signal processing
applications efficiently.

The mechanism via which CV32E40P cores in a PULP Cluster synchronize with each other is implemented via the custom **cv.elw** instruction
that performs a read transaction on an external Event Unit (which for example implements barriers and semaphores). This
read transaction to the Event Unit together with the ``core_sleep_o`` signal inform the Event Unit that the CV32E40P is not busy and 
ready to go to sleep. Only in that case the Event Unit is allowed to set ``pulp_clock_en_i`` to 0, thereby gating off ``clk_i``
internal to the core. Once the CV32E40P core is ready to start again (e.g. when the last core meets the barrier), ``pulp_clock_en_i`` is
set to 1 thereby enabling the CV32E40P to run again.

If the PULP Cluster extension is not used (``PULP_CLUSTER`` = 0), the ``pulp_clock_en_i`` signal is not used and should be tied to 0.

Execution of a **cv.elw** instructions causes ``core_sleep_o`` = 1 only if all of the following conditions are met:
 
 * The **cv.elw** did not yet complete (which can be achieved by witholding ``data_gnt_i`` and/or ``data_rvalid_i``)
 * No debug request is pending
 * The core is not in debug mode
 * The core is not single stepping (debug)
 * The core does not have a trigger match (debug)

As ``pulp_clock_en_i`` can directly impact the internal clock gate, certain requirements are imposed on the environment of CV32E40P
in case ``PULP_CLUSTER`` = 1:

 * If ``core_sleep_o`` = 0, then ``pulp_clock_en_i`` must be 1
 * If ``pulp_clock_en_i`` = 0, then ``irq_i[]`` must be 0           
 * If ``pulp_clock_en_i`` = 0, then ``debug_req_i`` must be 0    
 * If ``pulp_clock_en_i`` = 0, then ``instr_rvalid_i`` must be 0 
 * If ``pulp_clock_en_i`` = 0, then ``instr_gnt_i`` must be 0    
 * If ``pulp_clock_en_i`` = 0, then ``data_rvalid_i`` must be 0  
 * If ``pulp_clock_en_i`` = 0, then ``data_gnt_i`` must be 0
