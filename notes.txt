cli_test.bin is the actual application binary file generated
Header.bin is added to cli_test.bin at the beginning for the bootloader to understand and load the application.
So, Header.bin + cli_test.bin = cli.bin which is programmed into QSPI flash or is used by any external host to load using the bootloader via I2C bus.
For simulating the hardware, header.bin is changed a bit to header_sim.bin which skips the flash loading into RAM as the RAM in simulation is already initialized with the app code. So Header_sim.bin + cli_test.bin = cli_sim.bin.

Structure of header.bin which is added to cli_test.bin so that the bootloader can load the application code and boot.

typedef struct {
  uint32_t nextDesc;
  uint32_t nbAreas;  Number of areas in the header.
  uint32_t entry;    Entry address of the application code.
  uint32_t bootaddr; Boot address of the application code.
} __packed flash_v2_header_t;

typedef struct {
  uint32_t start;   From where does the application code start in this bin file. i.e. Index of the application code.
  uint32_t ptr;     
  uint32_t size;    Size of the block
  uint32_t blocks;  Number of blocks to read
} __packed flash_v2_mem_area_t;


typedef struct {	//16+256 = 272 bytes of header.
  flash_v2_header_t header;
  flash_v2_mem_area_t memArea[MAX_NB_AREA]; MAX_NB_AREA = 16 flash areas can be described
} __packed boot_code_t;


Total header size is 272 bytes. 16 bytes of header and 256 bytes of memory area.

Connecting an external host to load an application into Arnold2
Example host board: STM32F407 discovery kit
STM32 application is located at core-v-mcu-cli-test/STM32
STM32
PB6     Master SCL
PB9     Master SDA

Nexsys
JC10    Slave SCL
JC9     Slave SDA    

Connect 2 grounds between STM and Nexsys

1. Program STM32. Start STM32. All 4 LEDs will rapidly blink. This indicates that the STM has not detected Arnold2 slave.
2. Load the bit file into the SD card. Insert the SD card and power on the Nexsys board. Press program button to program the bit file to FPGA.
3. Open a terminal window for UART1 of Arnold2. Once the Nexsys bit file is programmed and done bit is high, you can see bootloader message from Arnold2 UART1 on the terminal. 
4. The value of the bootsel switch should be indicating 0 and dots will be printing indicating that Arnold2 bootloader is waiting for an external host to connect to it over I2C.
5. Now, reset the STM32 board. The green LED will stay on and red LED will keep blinking indicating that the host is loading the application over I2C.
6. Once the application is loaded, the orange led will glow indicating the completion of loading the application code. The blue LED will keep blinking to indicate that STM32 is in a while (1) loop.
7. Arnold 2 should have loaded the application and this can be verified by connecting a termial to UART0 and checking if the command line is up. I2C BL JMP 1c000880 is printed on the terminal connected to UART1 of Arnold2.

I2C protocol between an external host and Arnold2 bootloader

Arnold2 bootloader is running as an I2C slave with a 8-bit slave address 0x62

Protocol structure
2 Bytes   Start Of Frame (SOF)
4 Bytes   RAM address
1 Byte    Command type
1 Byte    Data length
240 Bytes Payload data
2 Bytes   CRC  (Optional)

Start Of Frame (SOF) indicates the message direction. A2 to Host is 0x5A70 and Host to A2 is 0xA507
RAM address indicates the A2 RAM address which needs to be written to read from.

All command and responses are implemented in the 1 byte I2C to APB / APB to I2C single-byte message register, except load memory command and jump to address command.
The command load memory uses the 256 byte deep FIFO to communicate with I2C slave. It uses the above mentioned protocol structure.

Arnold2 slave on booting up writes the reason for power on and waits for the host to connect on I2C bus.

- Initial connection process
The external host connects to the I2C slave and reads the reset reason.
Depending on the reset reason the host decides whether to program Arnold2 or not.

- Programming Arnold2 via I2C
1. The I2C master (external host) after the initial connection process, checks if the I2C slave (Arnold2) is ready. There are 2 options with CRC and without CRC.
Both options are supported by the example implementation.

2. The host waits until there is a response from the slave to be ready. Once the slave replies with a ready status, the host proceeds next.

3. The host sends the firmware data using the load command to the slave. If the CRC is enabled the host calculates the CRC and sends it in the CRC field.

4. The slave upon receiving the firmware data, checks the CRC and copies the data into the RAM addresss specified - if CRC is enabled or if CRC is disabled, the slave directly copies the data into the RAM address specified.

5. If the CRC check has failed, the slave informs the host, so that the host can retry the frame.

6. Once all firmware data is pushed to the slave, the host issues a jump to address command with the RAM address to jump.

7. The slave (Arnold2) jumps to the RAM address mentioned by the host.

Programming QSPI flash

launch spi_load.py in a terminal using 
python3 spi_load.py /dev/ttyUSB1

load the cli_test application on Arnold2.
Commands on Arnold2
qspi
program Default/cli.bin 0x0

Programming will start indicating the progress on Arnold2 UART terminal

To change the bootsel pin status:
Open the terminal connected to UART 1 of Arnold2. 
Load the bit file. 
Once the bit file is programmed, and running, check the status of bootsel print.
If boot sel status is to be changed, first set SW0 to low (south) and the set SW1 to high or low.
Then press reset button. Now the SW1 (bootsel) will be taken correctly.

When connecting JTAG interface to debug make sure that the SW0 switch is in high position (north) for the debugger to work.

For any change in SW0 or SW1 settings to be reflected, press reset button.
